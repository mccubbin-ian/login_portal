Login Portal by Ian McCubbin

This program is a simple login portal that contains both the server and client side portions required for logging in.

Usage:

1)  Start the service portal:

    connection = pika.BlockingConnection(pika.ConnectionParameters("localhost"))
    channel = connection.channel()

    channel.queue_declare(queue="login_queue")
    channel.basic_consume(queue="login_queue", on_message_callback=on_request)

    print("Login server is waiting for requests. To exit press CTRL+C")
    channel.start_consuming()
	
2)  Collect the login information (username, password)

3)	Create a LoginClient object.

4)  use response= LoginClient.login(username, password).  This will send a call to the service.

5)  The service will then search through the provided *.csv file for a matching user/pass credential.  This can be edited to match the end user's login credentials.
	a)  If found:  The service updates the csv with a timestamp of the last login, and returns a success message to the client
	b)  If not found:  the service will return a failure message to the client.

NOTE:  the current service is running under localhost.  If there is a different setting, the connection parameter must be modified.
